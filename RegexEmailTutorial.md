Regex Tutorial: Understanding Email Validation
Introduction
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used in programming for text processing and validation. This tutorial aims to demystify how regex is used to validate email addresses, breaking down the regex pattern to understand each of its components.

Summary
The regex pattern we'll be exploring is /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. This pattern is commonly used to validate the format of email addresses.

Table of Contents
Start of Line
Username Section
The "@" Symbol
Domain Section
Top-Level Domain
End of Line
Start of Line
^
This symbol represents the start of a string. It asserts that the following pattern must appear at the beginning of the string.

Username Section
([a-z0-9_\.-]+)
This portion of the regex captures the username part of an email. It includes:

Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Underscores (_)
Periods (.)
Hyphens (-)
The + indicates that one or more of these characters must be present.
The "@" Symbol
@
This is a literal character in the regex. The '@' symbol is a mandatory part of any email address, separating the username from the domain name.

Domain Section
([\da-z\.-]+)
This section matches the domain name of an email. It includes:

Digits (0-9)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Periods (.)
Hyphens (-)
Like the username section, the + means one or more of these characters are required.
Top-Level Domain
([a-z\.]{2,6})
This part of the regex is for matching the top-level domain (TLD). It allows:

Lowercase letters (a-z)
The {2,6} quantifier specifies that the TLD must have a length between 2 and 6 characters.
End of Line
$
This character signifies the end of the string. It asserts that the preceding pattern is the last thing in the string.

Conclusion
Through this tutorial, we've broken down a regex used for email validation, revealing how each part functions. Understanding regex patterns is crucial in tasks like data validation, ensuring inputs conform to expected formats.
